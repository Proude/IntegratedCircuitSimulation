# (2013) IntegratedCircuitSimulation

This project parses a netlist of an electronic circuit and solves the generated equations for DC analysis of the integrated circuit. Methods used in this project include:
* Conjugate and Biconjugate Gradient Method for dense and sparse matrices
* Backward Euler Method
* Trapezoidal method
* LU and Cholesky decomposition
